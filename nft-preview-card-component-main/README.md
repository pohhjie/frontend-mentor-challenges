# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

Hello! 

This is my first challenge from Frontend Mentor. It's been awhile since I worked on front-end web development and I happened to stumbled upon this website while browsing for resources that will help me to refresh my HTML and CSS knowledge after. So I signed up an account and decided to give this challenge a shot.
