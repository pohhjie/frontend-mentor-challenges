- [necolas/normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) - Kudos to Nicolas Gallagher for his work on normalize.css
- [Semantics HTML: Best Practices for 2019](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wordpress/semantic-html-best-practices-for-2019) - This article is written in 2019. I know it's kind of late but I want to start getting into the habit of using the right HTML semantics rather than using ```<div>``` for everything.
