### Useful resources

- [Unobtrusive Client Validation in ASP.NET MVC3](https://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/mvc3-unobtrusive-validation.html) - Informative article about how Microsoft uses unobtrusive front-end validation with jQuery which kind of inspires me to write something similar in Vanilla.JS except that it's not completed.
- [Sizing in CSS: px vs em vs rem](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/sizing-in-css-px-vs-em-vs-rem/) - Deciding which UOM to use for styling. My opinion is that text shouldn't resize automatically WRT to viewport's width & height.
- [necolas/normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) - Kudos to Nicolas Gallagher for his work on normalize.css
