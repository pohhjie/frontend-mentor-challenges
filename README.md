# Frontend Mentor Challenges

Hello! 

This repository contains all my submissions from [Frontend Monitor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## About

It's been awhile since I've worked on any front-end web development and I happened to stumble upon Frontend Mentor while browsing for resources that will help me to refresh my HTML and CSS knowledges.

Feel free to critique or give me any suggestions to improve my code.

Thank you.
